Truthy, Truth or Dare    <code>Made with \u2764\ufe0f</code>       It's been a year but it's time to say goodbye to Truthy, Truth or Dare finally.   </p> <p>Join our Support Discord</p>  <p> I'm disconnecting Truthy   <p>It's been a project I've worked on and maintained for over a year, something I've made friends by doing and met many lovely, unique and outstanding communities. A way for people to learn more about eachother, have fun together and explore the intanet in an exciting way. It's always been a complete joy to see Truthy grow into where it is and what it had became and it breaks my heart to finally let the project go. I wish I could say this was by choice by Discord and their support have whittled me down to my last thread and I'm finally going to cave and let them have their way.</p> <p>I can't continue to support an application and team that acts the way they do and treats developers the way they have. I'll add information below of the reason why Truthy is being disconnected, but I just want to say; There's one thing I will always adore and be thankful for, the people. The communities, the individuals who helped me with Truthy, who used Truthy in unique and amazing ways - who were positive and enjoyed Truthy within their Discords.</p> <p>To the few individuals who supported Truthy through our community donation page, all of you - are amazing. It means so much to me. I'm sorry to say goodbye, but here we are.</p> <p>Lots of love, Katie#2191    </p>  <p> The Why    Around 6 months ago a large bot developer making a competing Truth or Dare bot flagged Truthy, Truth or Dare to Discord moderation to have it removed from the Application Discovery, these kinds of bot developers have asigned partners / staff with Discord so get a direct communication line to quick support. This caused the removal of Truthy, Truth or Dare from Application Discovery for having Adult Content. <p>The bot developer that requested this removal also had Adult Content in their bot before removing it, I was told by Discord support I could appeal this decision and have Truthy, Truth or Dare re-instated. After working hard over the past 3 months with support and patience of my community all Adult Content was removed from Truthy and transferred into a new bot. Discord had promised that when I had removed this Adult content Truthy would be re-instated to the Application Discovery.</p> <p>Discord support lied. They lied and misslead, it is clear to me now that they never wanted Truthy back on Application Discovery, after appealing the decision I was told No., the reason is simply because of the removal. They refuse to overturn the decision, despite the fact they themselves stated once the Adult Content was remove, it'd come back. They have instead said once a violation is made, it's never allowed back.</p> <p>It's unfortunate and saddening to see this level of deceit coming from Discord, larger bots with partnered staff have much more strings to pull on to get their bots back onto Application Discovery (and prevent them being removed). </p> <p>Discord stripped Truthy of its impressive growth and didn't keep their word on fixing the issue, they've taken over 3 MONTHS and not even reviewed the second bots application for verification. I'm done waiting, it is clear that unless you have some partner you work along-side, it's a waste of time.    </p> <p> The Future    As of right now we have no plans to continue any projects with Discord, including Truthy, Truth or Dare. <p>If you have any questions please contact me on Katie#2191    </p>","text":""},{"location":"commands/","title":"Commands","text":"<p>Last Update: 12th of March, 2023.

Its always important that whilst using the service Discord provides you respect the people you choose to interact with. Be friendly, respectful and ensure people don't feel uncomfortable. <p>Whilst using Truthy you are still on the Discord platform and Discord Terms still apply to every message you send through Truthy, please refresh your memory of these terms.   </p> <p> A Good Foundation     Here are some guidelines to help you go into each conversation with a good foundation. Following these guidelines is absolutely required when using the \u260e\ufe0f Telephone command.</p> <ul> <li> Be Kind  It really is that simple, be kind to the people you're talking to at all times. This means you should remain respectful to everyone you speak to and understand boundries so you're never making anyone feel uncomfortable during your conversations. Pranks and Trolling can be funny when there's good intentions but make sure what you are doing is funny for both parties, not just yourself.</li> <li> Be yourself  Just be yourself and don't impersonate anyone. It can mislead, trick and confuse other users. Truthy staff never use the Telephone command. We ensure this so that all users know that everyone you speak to is a completely random user not connected with Truthy.</li> <li> Do not Advertise  Although we do allow our members to link Discords and share your communities, we believe connecting with eachother is important. However, this should not be your main purpose of using the Telephone. If you're entering calls only to paste links and advertise without meaningful conversation, you may be banned from using the command. </li> <li> Never Assume  You never know who you're speaking with, their gender, age, or anything about them. So respect these boundries and don't make assumptions. This means don't share Adult Content incase the person you're speaking to is much younger, don't share or promote discriminatory or insulting content.</li> <li> Actions We Take  Our own Trust &amp; Safety team actively monitors reports that come through the system. And we consider forwarding every report that violates Discord Terms of Service to the Discord Trust &amp; Safety email. As listed in our Privacy Policy, we log your <code>Message ID's</code>. So we will actively forward these to Discord in event of violations. </li> </ul>","text":""},{"location":"legal/privacy/","title":"Privacy Policy","text":"<p>Terms of Service for the following Application:</p> <p>Truthy, Truth or Dare#5515 | 941836651037098037</p> <p>Effective: 25th of February, 2022.
