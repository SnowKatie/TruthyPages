     <b>Theres Alternatives, Why use Truthy?</b>
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="subheading" color="inherit" noWrap>

- [x] No repeat questions
<br>
Unlike <b>many</b> other other similar bots, we use a dynamic lister that means you'll have to exhaust **all** of our questions before you'll be served a repeat question. You wont have to keep generating new questions till you encounter a new one.
- [x] We respect your <b>privacy</b>
<br>
Truthy exclusively uses ++slash++ ``Slash Commands``, which means you can entirely <b>disable</b> ``Message Read`` permissions and our bot will function perfectly fine. You can know for <b>certain</b> that our bot is not prying on your messages. We also do not plan to request intents for content from Discord which means at the end of August 2022, it will be impossible for us to view your messages with or without this permission.
- [x] We update very <b>frequently</b>
<br>
Go ahead and check ``/lastupdate`` - it's a very rare occasion that the command will show an update from more than ``48 hours`` ago, that's cause we're always adding new features. You can rest assured that this isn't some fake, auto-updating date, you'll see our question lists expand, new games come, and more.

    <b>Heya lovely guests,</b><br>
  My name is <b>Katie</b> and I'm the only active developer of Truthy! This bot began in a small server I threw together to enjoy with my friends - and it created a whole lot of amazing, funny <i>``and questionable``</i> moments! I wanted to share this love with other communities so I began working on Truthy and polishing the Bot to give it purpose in more Discords.

  I and my Moderation team were so excited when we hit that first 100 servers and it geninely made me happy to have my first Verified Bot. Now, we're in over ``2000`` servers and quickly growing. It makes me so proud to see how far such a small bot has come.

  Lots of ❤️,<br>
     - <b>Katie#2191</b><br>
