     <b>[I'm disconnecting Truthy](https://youtu.be/47dtFZ8CFo8?t=11)</b>
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="subheading" color="inherit" noWrap>

It's been a project I've worked on and maintained for over a year, something I've made friends by doing and met many lovely, unique and outstanding communities. A way for people to learn more about eachother, have fun together and explore the intanet in an exciting way. It's always been a complete joy to see Truthy grow into where it is and what it had became and it breaks my heart to finally let the project go. I wish I could say this was by choice by Discord and their support have whittled me down to my last thread and I'm finally going to cave and let them have their way.

I can't continue to support an application and team that acts the way they do and treats developers the way they have. I'll add information below of the reason why Truthy is being disconnected, but I just want to say; There's one thing I will always adore and be thankful for, the people. The communities, the individuals who helped me with Truthy, who used Truthy in unique and amazing ways - who were positive and enjoyed Truthy within their Discords.

To the few individuals who supported Truthy through our community donation page, all of you - are amazing. It means so much to me.
I'm sorry to say goodbye, but here we are.

Lots of love, Katie#2191

     <b>The Why</b>
     <br>
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="subheading" color="inherit" noWrap>
Around 6 months ago a large bot developer making a competing Truth or Dare bot flagged **Truthy, Truth or Dare** to Discord moderation to have it removed from the Application Discovery, these kinds of bot developers have asigned partners / staff with Discord so get a direct communication line to quick support. This caused the removal of Truthy, Truth or Dare from Application Discovery for having **Adult Content**.

The bot developer that requested this removal also had Adult Content in their bot before removing it, I was told by Discord support I could appeal this decision and have **Truthy, Truth or Dare** re-instated. After working hard over the past 3 months with support and patience of my community all Adult Content was removed from Truthy and transferred into a new bot. Discord had promised that when I had removed this Adult content Truthy would be re-instated to the Application Discovery.

**Discord support lied.** They lied and misslead, it is clear to me now that they never wanted Truthy back on Application Discovery, after appealing the decision I was told **No.**, the reason is simply because of the removal. They refuse to overturn the decision, despite the fact they themselves stated once the Adult Content was remove, it'd come back. They have instead said once a violation is made, it's never allowed back.

It's unfortunate and saddening to see this level of deceit coming from Discord, larger bots with partnered staff have much more strings to pull on to get their bots back onto Application Discovery (and prevent them being removed). 

Discord stripped Truthy of its impressive growth and didn't keep their word on fixing the issue, they've taken over **3 MONTHS** and not even reviewed the second bots application for verification. I'm done waiting, it is clear that unless you have some partner you work along-side, it's a waste of time.
