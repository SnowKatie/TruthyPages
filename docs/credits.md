    === "Who is Katie?"

        ```
        That's me! I developed Truthy from the ground up in 2022 which was only supposed to be a small bot
        for a couple friends and I. Truthy quickly grew beyond where I ever expected it to grow and here 
        we are with a website, vastly growing amount of servers and a lot of love and support. Thank you
        for everyone who's here with us.

        owe a lot for all the aid he's given!
