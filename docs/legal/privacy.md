*Welcome, Truthy is a fun and enjoyable bot for anybody to use in their Discord servers. These terms set forth our legal obligations to eachother. They apply to your use of our service.*

*When we say “Truthy,” “we,” and “our” in these terms, we mean the Truthy Application and its founder. When we say “services” in these terms, we mean the services Truthy provides. When we say “you” or your," we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity, you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and "your will refer to that entity.*

### **Who We Are**

### **What data we store**
!!! success "User Information"
    Below is an **explicit** list of exactly what data we store and when we store it

    ### ++slash++ **Stakes Game**
    **The Stakes game stores:** ``UserId`` ``Name`` ``Score`` ``Choice``<br>
    The only unique information the game stores is your **UserId** and **Name**. This is temporary and is cleared once the game is concluded or you request for it to be removed. We do not see any messages. The data of your **UserId** is required so we know who is playing, who's turn it is, and so we can limit the buttons to people in the game currently.

    ### ++slash++ **Mail Command**
    **The ``/Mail`` command stores:** ``UserId`` ``GuildId`` ``Message``<br>
    On the **/mail** command we store some of your information such as your **UserId** and the current **Guild** you sent the message from so we can give you a response to your ModMail. We also have to store the **Message** of what you sent us so we can actually see what you've written in your mail.

    ### ✅ **Thats it!**
    Yep, that little! We don't store any other information. Please know this Privacy Page **will** update when new commands that require new information to be stored are released.

!!! success "Discord Server Information"
    Below is an **explicit** list of exactly what data we store and when we store it

    ### ++slash++ **Mail Command**
    **The ``/Mail`` command stores:** ``UserId`` ``GuildId`` ``Message``<br>
    As mentioned in the *User Information* section, we store the GuildId temporarily for any guild the command is used in. This is so that our Moderators can send a response through the bot to the user who opened a ModMail. Without this information we would not be able to route the message. This information is deleted as soon as the response has been sent or the ticket has been closed.

!!! failure "Message Content"
    We **do not** and **never will** store any of your **messages** or their **content**. Truthy is built with the philosophy of minimal elevation. Which means we do a lot with little. Aka, we only ask for the **bare minimum** permissions. Truthy only actually requires **1 Permission** to run in the majority of Discords. And only asks currently for **3 Permissions**. 

    Truthy uses ++slash++ commands and **cannot** see your messages.

### **How long we store it**
