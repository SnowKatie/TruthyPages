*Welcome, Truthy is a fun and enjoyable bot for anybody to use in their Discord servers. These terms set forth our legal obligations to eachother. They apply to your use of our service.*

*When we say “Truthy,” “we,” and “our” in these terms, we mean the Truthy Application and its founder. When we say “services” in these terms, we mean the services Truthy provides. When we say “you” or your," we mean you. If you’re accessing our services on behalf of a legal entity, you agree that you have the authority to bind that entity to these terms, and “you” and "your will refer to that entity.*

### **Who We Are**
*We provide services that allow users on the Discord application to access commands that provide a wide range of enjoyable games. Truthy is developed by Katie whom develops these bots currently as a hobby.*

### **What data we store**
!!! success "User Information"
    Below is an **explicit** list of exactly what data we store and when we store it

    ### ++slash++ **Stakes Game**
    **The Stakes game stores:** ``User Id`` ``Name`` ``Score`` ``Choice``<br>
    The only unique information the game stores is your **UserId** and **Name**. This is temporary and is cleared once the game is concluded or you request for it to be removed. We do not see any messages. The data of your **UserId** is required so we know who is playing, who's turn it is, and so we can limit the buttons to people in the game currently.

    ### ++slash++ **Phone Command**
    **The ``/Phone`` command stores:** ``User Id`` ``Name`` ``Channel Id`` ``Message Id`` ``Message Content`` ``Gamemode``<br>
    When using this command we store **a lot** more information than our other commands. This is because this information is required to actively monitor and deal with reports. This command is the **only** command that actively logs messages sent through. This is vital and required for us to fill our responsibility to Discord in keeping content that violates Discord TOS off of our bot.

    ### ✅ **Thats it!**
    Yep, that little! We don't store any other information. Please know this Privacy Page **will** update when new commands that require new information to be stored are released.
