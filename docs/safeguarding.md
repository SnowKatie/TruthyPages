    Discord is a platform that connects people together and helps build communities of like-minded people who have fun together, play games and so much more. Its always important that whilst using the service Discord provides you respect the people you choose to interact with. Be friendly, respectful and ensure people don't feel uncomfortable.

     <b>A Good Foundation</b>
  </Typography>
  <br>
  Here are some guidelines to help you go into each conversation with a good foundation. Following these guidelines is <b>absolutely required</b> when using the ☎️ Telephone command.

- [x] **Be Kind**
<br>
It really is that simple, be kind to the people you're talking to at all times. This means you should remain **respectful** to everyone you speak to and understand boundries so you're **never making anyone feel uncomfortable** during your conversations. Pranks and Trolling can be funny when there's good intentions but make sure what you are doing is funny for both parties, not just yourself.
- [x] **Be yourself**
<br>
Just be yourself and don't impersonate anyone. It can mislead, trick and confuse other users. Truthy staff **never** use the Telephone command. We ensure this so that all users know that everyone you speak to is a completely random user not connected with Truthy.
- [x] **Do not Advertise**
<br>
Although we do allow our members to link Discords and share your communities, we believe connecting with eachother is important. However, this should not be your main purpose of using the Telephone. If you're entering calls only to paste links and advertise without meaningful conversation, you may be banned from using the command. 
- [x] **Never Assume**
<br>
You never know who you're speaking with, their gender, age, or anything about them. So respect these boundries and don't make assumptions. This means don't share Adult Content incase the person you're speaking to is much younger, don't share or promote discriminatory or insulting content.
- [ ] **Actions We Take**
<br>
Our own **Trust & Safety** team actively monitors reports that come through the system. And we **consider** forwarding every report that violates Discord Terms of Service to the Discord **Trust & Safety** email. As listed in our [Privacy Policy](../legal/privacy), we log your ``Message ID's``. So we will actively forward these to Discord in event of violations.
