    === "Who is Katie?"

        ```
        That's me! I developed Truthy from the ground up in 2022 which was only supposed to be a small bot
        for a couple friends and I. Truthy quickly grew beyond where I ever expected it to grow and here 
        we are with a website, vastly growing amount of servers and a lot of love and support. Thank you
        for everyone who's here with us.

        been here to help with support, Truthy wouldn't be where it was without him nor as successful and I
        owe a lot for all the aid he's given!
